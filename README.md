# Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) 

This project builds a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) system for reconstructing 3D scenes and generating photorealistic novel views from a limited set of images. By learning a continuous neural representation of scene geometry and appearance, the model can render realistic images from new viewpoints not present in the training data. The project demonstrates techniques in 3D scene representation, differentiable rendering, and deep learning–based view synthesis.
